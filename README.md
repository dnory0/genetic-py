# Genetic Py

A Simulator that solves optimization problems using Genetic Algorithms and shows results on charts.

> **Note:** The Project is in development stage (anything may change or be removed on the future).

### This project exists for the following reasons:

1. Try to present a simple tool to use genetic algorithms to solve optimization problems.
2. This project is going to be my graduation project.

## Download

You can find corresponding installer or partable to download on [releases](https://github.com/dnory0/genetic-py/releases).

## Developer?

If you are a developer and you want to run the code on your machine, do the following:

1. You need to have installed:

   - NodeJS (recommended 10.x or above).
   - Python 3.6 or above.
   - Yarn (optional, but recommended).

2. Run on CLI:

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/dnory0/genetic-py.git
   cd genetic-py
   yarn # or npm install
   ```

3. Run the application:

   - on development mode (to be able to open devTools):

   ```sh
   yarn dev # or npm run dev
   ```

   - on production mode:

   ```sh
   yarn start # or npm run start
   ```

   > Note that development, production, and packaged are different modes, you get development by running the application using `yarn dev`, or with any of the dev flags `-d` `-D` `--dev`, production mode is when you run the application using `yarn start`. Packaged in the other hand is totally different, you get it using the build or dist script, the packaged app runs by default on production, unless it is specified with the dev flags mentioned before.
