# Genetic Py

A Simulator that solves optimization problems using Genetic Algorithms & Quantum Genetic Algorithms and shows results on charts. The Project is in development stage (Anything may change or be removed on the future).

## Why?

1. This project is going to be my licence graduation project.
2. I love Quantum Algorithms ðŸš€ðŸš€.

## How to try it?

1. Python 3.6 and above, NodeJS (recommended is 10.x and above) are needed to be
   installed in your machine.
2. execute the following on your terminal (or cmd on Windows):

```sh
git clone https://github.com/dnory0/genetic-py.git # downloads a copy of the app
cd genetic-py
npm install # installs dependencies
npm start # starts the app
```
