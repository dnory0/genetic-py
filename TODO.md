# python part

make GA accept random flags through sys.argv

### exclude some files that are not of any use in production mode

## improvements: (@deprecated for now)

- make timeChecker being cleared when timer paused instead of using
  sendTime variable, create new time checker when timer resumed.
- put the whole process work on a class for possibility to instantiate
  more than one timer when needed.
- move it to be a thread on the renderer process instead of separate one

# for me:

- learn docker
- learn venv
- learn to debug
- learn using tests
